# Stock dashboard
Stock Dashboard is a Python-based financial analytics application built with Streamlit. It provides users with economic and stock market insights in Czech, powered by an AI assistant via an AI API. The application fetches financial data using Yahoo Finance and Finnhub, while the Streamlit frontend ensures an interactive user experience.  

### Features:  
- **AI-powered insights**: Users can enter a company ticker, and the AI assistant will provide key financial and stock-related information in Czech.  
- **STOCK price chart**: A line chart (based on closing prices) visualizing the selected company's stock movements over a user-defined period. Includes a SPY benchmark line for comparison.
- **Data source**: All stock market data is retrieved via the **Yahoo Finance API** and **FINNHUB API**.  

ðŸš€ This tool provides users with essential company insights in Czech and an interactive stock chart with customizable parameters!
